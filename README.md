# Viscel

## About

Viscel is a desktop application that allows gamers to create and customize personalized settings for any game they desire.
The app was built using **React.js**, **Electron**, **TypeScript**, alongside **Vite** to build the front-end and **Electron-builder** to package the app; this enables the app to run on multiple operating systems.

## Features

- **Different Colour Blind Modes** - A setting to enhance visibility for those who are colour blind.
- **Sensitivity Transfer** - With the press of a key, the user can transfer mouse sensitivities from game-to-game, avoiding the hassle of having to try and adjust their sensitivity every-time when playing a new game.
- **Smart Audio** - When in a call while playing a game, Smart Audio automatically lowers game audio momentarily when someone speaks, and then goes back to normal once they stop talking.
